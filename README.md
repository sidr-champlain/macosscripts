# macosscripts catalog


Welcome to macosscripts catalog. The files above can be utilized for automating task on a new or current install of macOS. It is recommended to read each file and understand what the scripts will accomplish. 

There are files that require the HomeBrew Package Manager. Please visit their official website to see the installation process. Once you have that installed, come back here for those specific files. 

The files that have the extension AppleScript are scripts directory for macOS. You will need to download them first to change the credentials. Once complete, save the new script file as an application so you don't need to constantly open Script Editor to run each file.

I have left comments on each script explaining the process so hopefully you won't get lost. These are very simple and you can even take these a step further.
